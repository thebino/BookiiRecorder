# üë®üî¨ Engineering

A Bookii Pen device is build for children by [Tessloff](https://kinder-jugendbuch-verlage.de/de/verlage/tessloff-verlag/)
Underneath the hardware is build on a [Sonix OID3 SN9P702BFG](https://www.sonix.com.tw/article-en-1686-29170) OID Decoder to identify patterns of black squares.

By holding the device close to an OID supported book, paper or sticker the CMOS-Sensor in the device will scan the pattern and converts it to a [OID](https://www.sonix.com.tw/category-en-956)
